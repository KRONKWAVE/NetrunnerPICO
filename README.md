# NetrunnerPICO
Code for using a Raspberry Pi PICO with PIMORONI's Pico Display Pack as a Netrunner counter

What is NetrunnerPICO?
NetrunnerPICO is a passion project, bringing together a love of Netrunner (formerly Android: Netrunner) and an interest in embedded systems. Embracing the cyberpunk aesthetic, the NetrunnerPICO project aims to make freely available the code to create a click/credit counter for Netrunner from easily accessible electronics. Using a Raspberry Pi PICO (https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) and PIMORONI's PICO Dispaly Pack (https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-display-pack) the code contained within this repository will allow you to create your own click tracker.
